Unique Features:

1. Landmark Search Based on Location and Radius:
The website allows users to search for landmarks based on a specific location (e.g., "Bangalore" â€” note the capital 'B') and a defined radius.
At the moment, our database only contains data for Bangalore, and users can explore and select landmarks within this city.
We are working on expanding the database to include other locations in the future.

3. Create and Join Travel Plans:
Through the "Connect" page, users can create their own travel plans, detailing the trip's title, description, landmarks, and other key information.
Users can also invite others to join their plans by sending email invitations. These invitations allow others to express interest in participating in the travel plan.
